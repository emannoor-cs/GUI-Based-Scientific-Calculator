##  About The Project
Hey! This is my implementation of a **Scientific Calculator** built completely in Java. 

Most simple calculators get confused if you try to do `5 + 2 * 10` (they might say 70 instead of 25). My calculator is smarter than that! It follows proper math rules (BODMAS/PEMDAS) and looks good doing it.

###  What Makes It Cool?
* **🌙 Dark Mode UI:** Easy on the eyes with a modern material design.
* **🎨 Custom Buttons:** No boring, blocky Java buttons here! I designed rounded, smooth keys.
* **🧠 Smart Logic:** It handles brackets `()`, powers `^`, and priority operations correctly.
* **🔢 Scientific Functions:** Includes `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, Factorials `!`, and more.

## How to Run It
You don't need anything fancy to run this. Just standard Java!

1.  **Download the code** (Clone the repo or download ZIP).
2.  **Open the folder** in VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse.
3.  **Run** the `ScientificCalculator.java` file.

Or, if you love the terminal:
```bash
javac ScientificCalculator.java
java ScientificCalculator
